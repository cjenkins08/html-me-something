        <p> In my life I've held several jobs. For the most part each of those jobs were a part of the customer service indusry. My very first job was a sales associate position in the toys department at a Walmart. Since then I followed that pattern into working similar positions. </p>

        <p> I've since have worked as a cashier, a stock associate, a caregiver, a warehouse worker, and as a call center representative. </p>
        
        <p> In addition, I also went to a University to get my Bachelors in Video Production and worked various intern positions. Now I am interested in learning how to develop websites/web apps that are inclusive of mp4 video's. So to learn about coding I decided to go to Launchcode! </p>
        
        <p> So by now you're probably wondering how old I am to have worked all these jobs and still be in school? But I'll never tell! </p>
